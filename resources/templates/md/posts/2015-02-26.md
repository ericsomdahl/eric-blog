### Hi There

This is my first post to what I hope will be a vaguely useful blog.  If only for myself -- as a means of recording useful things I stumble across
as I solve problems in either my work or my recreational software development.

I may also post about motorcycles.  Or judo. I like to learn about those things as well.

I think my first task will be to do something to automate this posting workflow. I am currently learning Clojure <http://clojure.org> and in an effort to eat some
of my own dogfood I am using Cryogen <http://cryogenweb.org> to generate this site.  Surely there is some way to get Leiningen <http://leiningen.org/> to
push this to Github for me...
