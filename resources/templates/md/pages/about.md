##  Eric Somdahl

Who Am I?
 * Senior full stack developer
 * judoka
 * motorcycle rider

I am an experienced cat herder and I have mastered the art of saying "no." I have enough OCD to be very good at development while retaining the ability to communicate
with the business set.  Through bitter experience I have learned the importance of testing software.  I am experienced with Agile practices but
am not afraid to break the rules when necessary.

My true strength as a developer is on the back end on the JVM (Java/Scala). I am eager to learn new techniques and technologies.

Fun fact: I never get hangovers. And I accept your challenge.
